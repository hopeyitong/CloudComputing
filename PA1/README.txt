Benchmarking
There are four sections to the assignment:
1)CPU
2)Memory
3)Disk
4)Network
CPU
CPU has two parts
The GIOPS and FLOPS calculation:
This experiment is to compute GFLOPS and GIOPS
This is done by two programs. cpu_test_original.c and cpu_avx.c
This experiment can be run by running the following command
Optional 1:
$ ./cpu_1.sh
Optional 2:
gcc1 -pthread cpu_test_original.c
./a.out
gcc1 -mavx2 -pthread cpu_avx.c
./a.out
The 600 sample program:
This experiment is to do integer and float operations for 10 minutes and produce 600 IOPS samples and 600 FLOPS samples
This is done by one program 600_sample_test.c
This experiment can be run by running the following command
Optional 1:
$ ./cpu_2.sh
Optional 2:
gcc1 -pthread 600_sample_test.c
./a.out>>sample.file
Memory
This experiment consists of 3 functions that do sequential memory access, sequential write and random write using 8B,8KB, 8MB and 80MB block size
This experiment is run by the program memory_test.c
This can be run by the following command
Optional 1:
$./memory.sh
Optional 2:
gcc1 -pthread memory_test.c
./a.out

Disk
This is experiment do sequential memory access, sequential write and random write using 8B,8KB, 8MB and 80MB block size
This experiment is run by the program disk.c
This can be run by the following command
Since it will take very long time to execute diskpart if block size if small (due to 10GB file), especially for read+write. We set initial NUM_LOOPS as 1.0e9, you may change NUM_LOOPS(which is the read data size) and rewrite data size(in call_Read_Write() and Read_Write() functions) according to tables in performance file to get our reasonable run time.
To compile disk:
find file location for two files: WriteFile.c disk.c
In linux terminal, type:
gcc writeFile.c -o writeFile
./writeFile
***note: if it shows error message, that means you donâ€™t have write permission yet. Then you should type:
sudo ./writeFile
Then ype:
 gcc disk.c -pthread -o disk
./disk Read_Write/Read_Seq/Read_Ran 8B/8KB/8MB/80MB 1/2/4/8


Network
To compile network:
find file location for two files: network_server.c network_client.c
In linux terminal, type:
gcc network_server.c -pthread -o server
gcc network_client.c -pthread -o client
In one terminal, type:
./server tcp/udp 1/2/4/8
In another terminal, type:
./client tcp/udp 1/2/4/8
***NOTE: If client side show connection failed, you can try repeat last two steps, and it will work. This might be caused by network traffic
